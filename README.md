This project explores the indicators of heart disease through a comprehensive Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling. This study utilizes a dataset containing a wide range of health-related and demographic variables to investigate potential risk factors and predictors of heart disease. This project aims to provide insights into the relationships between various indicators and the likelihood of heart disease, ultimately contributing to our understanding of cardiovascular health.
