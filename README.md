# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project explores the indicators of heart disease through a comprehensive Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling. This study utilizes a dataset containing a wide range of health-related and demographic variables to investigate potential risk factors and predictors of heart disease. This project aims to provide insights into the relationships between various indicators and the likelihood of heart disease, ultimately contributing to our understanding of cardiovascular health. 

The dataset utilized is directly sourced from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a widely recognized initiative by the CDC. It was collected by the CDC in 2022 and released in September 2023, ensuring temporal relevance that aligns with current health trends, thereby enhancing the applicability of the findings to the contemporary public health landscape.

This project is in Python.
